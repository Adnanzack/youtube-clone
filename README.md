# youtube-clone project by using google cloud api 


This JavaScript project fetches data from the YouTube API to display popular videos. It retrieves video details such as title and thumbnail, along with the channel's icon, using the video and channel endpoints. The fetched data is then used to dynamically create video cards, each linking to the corresponding YouTube video. Additionally, it allows users to search for videos using a search bar.
